# Housing Prices Advanced Regression Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices using advanced regression techniques. The dataset used is the **Ames Housing dataset**, which contains various features such as lot size, number of rooms, location, and house conditions.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a **Machine Learning model** that accurately predicts house prices based on various features. This is a **regression problem** where we minimize the error between predicted and actual prices.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Dataset**: Ames Housing Dataset
- **Target Variable**: `SalePrice` (House Price)
- **Features**: Various structural, locational, and neighborhood features

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🧐
   - Understanding data distributions and missing values
   - Feature correlations and outliers detection

2. **Data Preprocessing** ⚙️
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature engineering and scaling

3. **Model Selection & Training** 🤖
   - Implementing regression models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna**
   - Cross-validation to ensure robustness

4. **Evaluation & Results** 📈
   - RMSE, MAE, R² scores on validation data
   - Model comparison and selection

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
- **Scikit-Learn** 🤖
- **XGBoost** ⚡
- **Pandas & NumPy** 📊
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📉
